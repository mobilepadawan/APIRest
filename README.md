# TRAILERFLIX
This project was born as an **Ajax Project**, emulating a video streaming platform.
It's the same to a video streaming platform, limited to the trailer's view. All the trailers available are taken from Youtube (_most of them coming from the official channels_).

## FRAMEWORKS
I am using two simple frameworks:
### FRAMEWORK CSS
I am integrating Materialize CSS for the UI. I use it locally.

### FRAMEWORK JS
I am using JQuery 3.5.1 for the simple animations on the HTML documents and AJAX() to get the movies and series information.

### MOVIES & SERIES DB
I taken from a local JSON file. The movie and series cover was taken from the Internet, sizing normalized by me, and every information charged on the JSON file was made for me. Any things was invented, another things are real and maybe taken from Wikipedia, IMDB or similar site.

## SCREENSHOTS
These are some screenshots of the Web App, showing the different screens and support responsiveness behaivor.
