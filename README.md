# AJAX and API REST PROJECTS
I have two projects on this respository, both using AJAX() to query and show data on screen.
* Ajax - TrailerFlix (_a kind of video and series streaming platform_)
* coderbook (_a kind of social network search engine._)

## TRAILERFLIX
This project was born as an **Ajax Project**, emulating a video streaming platform.
As seen in the common video streaming platforms, but limited to trailer's watching __;)__.

All the trailers available are dinamically linked from Youtube (_most of them are coming from the official YT channels_).

### FRAMEWORKS
I am using two simple frameworks:
#### CSS
Materialize CSS is integrated for solving the UI. I use it locally.
#### JS
I also added __JQuery 3.5.1__ for basic animations on the HTML documents and __AJAX()__ to get and show on screen the movies and series information.

### DB for MOVIES & SERIES
I am taking the information of movies and series from a local JSON file. The cover images were taken from the Internet. The image sizing was normalized by me, and every block of text information on the JSON file was written for me. Some things are invented. Other things are real and maybe, a couple of them, were taken from Wikipedia, IMDB or a similar website.

### SCREENSHOTS
These are some screenshots of this Web App, showing the different screens and the correct behavior for the mobile-first paradigm.

## CODERBOOK
This project is using the __randomuser.me API__ to get a list of users, emulating the typical Social Networks user search engine.
I use __$.AJAX()__ to get the data and __JQuery animations__.

### FRAMEWORKS
#### CSS
I integrated __Materialize CSS__ for solving the __UI__. I use it locally.
#### JS
I added JQuery 3.5.1 to show a basic hide() and show() effects over different HTML sections after the query ends, and AJAX() to read the Rest API from randomuser.me and iterate with every item to load and show it on screen as seen on any searching result.

### SCREENSHOTS
Following the paradigm of Trailerflix App, __Coderbook__ is also behavioring fine on both ecosystems: __mobile__ and __web__.
